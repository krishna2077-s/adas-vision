# ADAS Vision

An open, low-cost Advanced Driver Assistance System built to run on hardware people already own — a dashcam or webcam and a standard laptop CPU. No GPU, no cloud, no dedicated hardware.

**Phases 1–3 (this release): real-time lane detection with steering suggestions, object detection with collision warnings, and a decision engine that fuses both into a single arbitrated driving action every frame.**

## What it does

**Lane detection (Module 1)**
- Detects lane markings from dashcam footage or a live webcam in real time
- Calculates the vehicle's drift from lane centre every frame
- Outputs a live steering suggestion (`STRAIGHT`, `SLIGHT LEFT`, `MODERATE RIGHT`, `HARD LEFT`, ...)
- Reports a confidence score and explicitly says so when it cannot see lanes

**Object detection (Module 2)**
- Detects road-relevant objects with YOLOv8n — cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians, two-wheelers, animals
- Estimates each object's distance from a monocular bounding-box heuristic
- Determines which objects are in the vehicle's forward path (perspective-aware corridor)
- Assigns LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH risk and raises a Forward Collision Warning banner

**Decision engine (Module 3) — the brain**
- Fuses the two modules' *results* (never pixels) into one arbitrated action per frame
- **Longitudinal**: `PROCEED → CAUTION → SLOW → BRAKE → EMERGENCY_STOP`, driven by the nearest in-path hazard, its estimated distance, and a smoothed closing speed / time-to-collision
- **Lateral**: `KEEP_LANE / CORRECT_LEFT / CORRECT_RIGHT / HOLD`, taken from the lane offset but *safety-clamped* — it never steers toward a hazard and never overrides braking
- **Temporal debouncing** so a single noisy frame (one spurious box, one distance spike, one dropped lane) can't flip the action: escalation is fast, release is slow, and an emergency stop latches
- **Degraded mode**: when lanes are lost it says so and behaves conservatively instead of pretending certainty
- Emits one plain-English **reason** per frame, e.g. `[R2] BRAKE: car closing, 7.1m TTC 2.1s`

All three modules run together at interactive frame rates on a standard laptop CPU — no GPU.

## How it works

**Module 1** — classical computer vision, no neural network:

```
Frame → Grayscale + Gaussian blur
      → Canny edge detection
      → Trapezoidal region-of-interest mask   (ignore sky / bonnet / roadside)
      → Probabilistic Hough transform          (find line segments)
      → Slope filtering + left/right split     (reject non-lane lines)
      → Per-side averaging + extrapolation     (one clean line per lane)
      → Exponential moving average             (stable lanes across frames)
      → Lane-centre offset → steering decision
```

**Module 2** — YOLOv8n inference plus geometry:

```
Frame → YOLOv8n detection (COCO classes, filtered to road-relevant)
      → Monocular distance estimate (pinhole model, per-class heights)
      → In-path test against Module 1's lane centre
      → Distance + path → risk level → collision warning
```

Module 2 uses the lane centre from Module 1 to decide what counts as "in front of us," so the two modules genuinely cooperate rather than just sharing a window.

**Module 3** — sensor fusion + arbitration, an explainable rule engine (no neural network):

```
Lane result + Object result
      → threat tracker      (smooth noisy distance, reject spikes, derive
                             closing speed + real-seconds TTC, hold on dropouts)
      → policy table R1..R7  (ordered, first-match-wins → raw action 0-4;
                             collision rules on top so safety dominates)
      → temporal ratchet     (fast N-of-M escalation, slow release, emergency
                             latch → committed action; one bad frame can't flip it)
      → lateral arbitration  (steer from lanes, but only ever reduce authority)
      → one DrivingDecision + a plain-English reason
```

The whole engine is a handful of scalar operations over the two result objects, so it adds negligible CPU on top of lane + YOLO.

> **Note on distance:** a single camera cannot measure true distance. Estimates come from apparent object size and are meant for relative "is this getting closer" logic, not survey-grade measurement. The decision engine smooths these estimates and reasons about *trends* (closing vs. receding) rather than trusting any single reading.

## Project layout

```
adas-vision/
├── config.py            ← All tunable parameters (all three modules)
├── lane_detection.py    ← Module 1: LaneDetector       (classical CV)
├── object_detection.py  ← Module 2: ObjectDetector      (YOLOv8n)
├── decision_engine.py   ← Module 3: DecisionEngine      (fusion + arbitration)
├── main.py              ← CLI entry point: runs all three modules together
└── requirements.txt
```

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This pulls in OpenCV, NumPy, and Ultralytics (which brings a CPU build of PyTorch for Module 2). On first run, YOLOv8n weights (~6 MB) download automatically. Lane detection alone needs only OpenCV + NumPy — run with `--no-objects` if you haven't installed Ultralytics yet.

## Usage

```bash
# Webcam — both modules
python main.py --camera

# Dashcam video — both modules
python main.py --video dashcam.mp4

# Lanes only (skip YOLO)
python main.py --video dashcam.mp4 --no-objects

# Objects only
python main.py --video dashcam.mp4 --no-lanes

# Debug overlay (ROI + raw Hough lines) and save annotated output
python main.py --video dashcam.mp4 --debug --save output.mp4
```

Controls while running:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Q` | Quit |
| `D` | Toggle debug overlay |
| `P` | Pause / resume |
| `S` | Save screenshot |

## On-screen display

- Green lines — detected left/right lanes, with translucent lane-area fill
- Yellow marker — computed lane centre vs. frame centre
- Coloured boxes — detected objects (green/amber/red by risk); thicker = in your path
- **Top-left HUD** — lane FPS, pixel offset, confidence, per-lane status, steering
- **Top-right panel** — the fused decision: longitudinal state (colour-coded, flashes on EMERGENCY), brake bar, lateral action, nearest-in-path object with distance + TTC, and a `DEGRADED` chip when inputs are untrusted
- **Bottom reason strip** — the one-line, rule-tagged explanation for the current action
- Bottom bar — drift indicator (fills red on hard drift)

## Tuning

Everything is in [config.py](config.py). The three settings that matter most:

| Setting | When to change |
|---|---|
| `ROI_*` fractions | Lanes cut off, or too much roadside noise detected |
| `CANNY_LOW` / `CANNY_HIGH` | Faded markings missed (lower them) or too many edges (raise them) |
| `SMOOTHING_ALPHA` | Lanes jittery (lower it) or slow to react in curves (raise it) |

For the decision engine (Module 3), the settings that matter most:

| Setting | When to change |
|---|---|
| `TTC_BRAKE_S` / `TTC_EMERGENCY_S` | Braking feels late (raise) or too twitchy (lower) |
| `DIST_EMERGENCY_M` / `RISK_DISTANCE_HIGH` | Distance at which it panics vs. brakes firmly |
| `HOLD_FRAMES` / `ESC_*` | Actions flicker (raise the debounce) or react too slowly (lower it) |
| `VULNERABLE_CLASSES` | Which objects (pedestrians, two-wheelers, cattle) earn earlier braking |

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — Lane detection + steering suggestion
- [x] **Phase 2** — Object detection + distance + collision warnings (YOLOv8n on CPU)
- [x] **Phase 3** — Decision engine fusing lanes + objects into a single arbitrated action, with temporal debouncing and a degraded mode
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Indian-road robustness: unmarked lanes, mixed traffic, night driving

## Design principles

1. **Runs on what you have** — CPU-only, standard Python, two dependencies
2. **Fails safely** — the system reports low confidence instead of guessing
3. **Explainable** — every decision can be traced through the pipeline
